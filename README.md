# HackerEarth-ML-OCR_SentimentAnalysis

Author: Niket Ganatra (GitHub: https://github.com/dev-niket ) (HackerEarth: www.hackerearth.com/@niket82 )

This repository contains my solution to the problem of the HackerEarth ML Challenge which was held during July, 2020. I got a rank of 109 out of 5042 participants worldwide (top 2.2%).

The challenge was based on 2 traditional and probably a little high level uses of Deep Learning (which is a subset of Machine Learning), Optimal Character Recognition (OCR), which comes under Computer Vision, and Sentiment Analysis, which is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application.

The dataset contained images which had quotes and tweets posted during the Pride month. The task was to extract the text from these images and analyse what kind of sentiment did they carry. The sentiment could either be 'Positive', 'Negative' or 'Random'. You can see the detailed problem statement in the file I have uploaded in the repository or using the link provided at the end of this file. This was a classic Unsupervised Learning application and no dataset was provided to train our model and as a result, I went ahead with solving the problem using 'R' rather than 'Python due to the presence of the 'tidytext' package in R. You can read my detailed approach to solve the problem in the file I will upload in the repository.
